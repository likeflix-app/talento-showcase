# üöÄ Fix Render Deployment - SPA Routing Issue

## ‚ùå Problem
The `/verify-email` route shows "404 Not Found" in production because Render is not handling SPA (Single Page Application) routing correctly.

## ‚úÖ Solution - Configure Render Properly

### Option 1: Use render.yaml (RECOMMENDED)

The `render.yaml` file is already configured in the repository. Make sure Render is using it:

1. **Go to your Render dashboard**
2. **Select your service** (talento-showcase or frontend-isadora)
3. **Go to Settings**
4. **Scroll to "Build & Deploy"**
5. **Check these settings:**
   - **Build Command**: `npm install && npm run build`
   - **Publish Directory**: `dist`
   - **Auto-Deploy**: Yes

### Option 2: Manual Configuration

If render.yaml is not being recognized:

1. **Go to your Render dashboard**
2. **Select your service**
3. **Go to "Redirects/Rewrites"** tab
4. **Add this rewrite rule:**
   - **Source**: `/*`
   - **Destination**: `/index.html`
   - **Type**: `Rewrite` (not Redirect)

### Option 3: Verify Files are Deployed

After deployment, check if these files exist in your deployed site:

- `/_redirects` - Should contain SPA routing rules
- `/static.json` - Backup configuration
- `/index.html` - Main HTML file

## üîç Testing

After applying the fix:

1. **Redeploy your site**
2. **Wait for deployment to complete**
3. **Test the verification link**: `https://frontend-isadora.onrender.com/verify-email?token=test123`
4. **You should see**: Your React app (not 404)

## üìù Additional Notes

- The `_redirects` file in `public/` folder is automatically copied to `dist/` during build
- Render should respect the `_redirects` file for SPA routing
- If still not working, contact Render support to enable SPA mode for your static site

## üÜò Still Having Issues?

If none of the above works, you may need to:
1. **Delete the service** in Render
2. **Create a new static site** from scratch
3. **Ensure "SPA" or "Single Page App" mode is enabled** during creation
